# Weather Data Processing and Analysis System

## Cloud Architecture Overview
![Cloud Architecture](C:\Users\dell\Desktop\me\Screenshot%202024-10-27%20184559.png)
This project implements a cloud-based system for processing and analyzing weather data using various AWS services and open-source technologies.



## Components

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Weather API
   - Apache Kafka
   - Apache ZooKeeper

2. **Data Processing**
   - Apache Spark Streaming

3. **Data Storage and Management**
   - Amazon S3
   - AWS Glue (Data Catalog & Crawler)

4. **Data Analysis**
   - Amazon Athena
   - AWS Lambda
   - OpenSearch (formerly Elasticsearch)

5. **Containerization**
   - Docker

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Data Ingestion

- Set up a Weather API client to fetch data
- Configure Kafka and ZooKeeper using Docker:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d zookeeper kafka
  ```
- Create a Kafka topic for weather data:
  ```bash
  kafka-topics --create --topic weather-data --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
  ```

### 2. Data Processing

- Set up Spark Streaming to consume data from Kafka and process it in real-time
- Deploy Spark application:
  ```bash
  spark-submit --class com.example.WeatherDataProcessor --master spark://localhost:7077 weather-processor.jar
  ```

### 3. AWS Services Configuration

- Set up an S3 bucket for storing processed data
- Configure AWS Glue:
  - Create a database in the Glue Data Catalog
  - Set up a Glue Crawler to catalog the data in S3
- Set up Amazon Athena for querying the processed data
- Create Lambda functions for additional processing and pushing data to OpenSearch

### 4. OpenSearch Setup

- Deploy OpenSearch cluster
- Configure Lambda function to push processed data from S3 to OpenSearch

## Usage

1. Start the data ingestion process to fetch weather data and send it to Kafka
2. Run the Spark Streaming job to process incoming data
3. Use AWS Glue to organize and catalog the data in S3
4. Query the processed data using Amazon Athena
5. Visualize and analyze real-time data in OpenSearch dashboards

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health and performance of AWS services
- Regularly update and patch all components, especially open-source tools
- Perform periodic reviews of data quality and system performance

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper IAM roles and policies for AWS services
- Secure Kafka and ZooKeeper clusters
- Encrypt data at rest in S3 and in transit
